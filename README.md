This program is designed to help users assess the strength of their passwords by analyzing key characteristics such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, the tool provides a detailed breakdown of the password's composition, giving users valuable insights into how they can improve the security of their passwords.

The script works by first taking a password input from the user. It then evaluates the password based on five criteria: length (at least 8 characters), presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. For each criterion met, the script assigns a score, which determines the overall strength of the password. If the password meets all the criteria, it is categorized as "Very Strong." If it meets fewer criteria, it is labeled as "Strong," "Medium," or "Weak." The tool also provides specific feedback, suggesting areas for improvement if the password is not strong enough.

In addition to assessing the password's strength, the script counts and prints the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters present in the password. This detailed analysis helps users understand the makeup of their password and identify any weak points, such as a lack of special characters or an overreliance on lowercase letters. The total length of the password is also displayed, reinforcing the importance of creating a password that is sufficiently long.

The user interaction is straightforward. After entering the password, the tool immediately provides a summary of the password's strength and composition. This allows users to see at a glance whether their password is secure or if it needs to be enhanced. By offering both qualitative feedback and quantitative analysis, the script not only guides users in creating stronger passwords but also educates them on the elements that contribute to a robust and secure password.

This tool is particularly useful for anyone looking to enhance their online security by creating stronger, more complex passwords. It simplifies the process of evaluating password strength, making it accessible even to those who may not have a deep understanding of cybersecurity principles.
